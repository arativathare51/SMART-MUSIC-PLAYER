# SMART-MUSIC-PLAYER
This project presents a smart music player application that integrates real-time hand gesture recognition to control audio playback. Utilizing computer vision techniques, the system interprets specific hand gestures to perform actions such as play, pause, next, and previous track selection. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Tkinter, providing users with visual feedback and manual control options. A MySQL database is employed to manage the playlist and record play history, enabling personalized user experiences. The gesture recognition module operates concurrently with the GUI using multithreading, ensuring seamless and responsive interaction. This approach enhances user engagement by offering an intuitive, contactless method of controlling music playback. Additionally, a pie chart generated using Matplotlib visually represents the number of times each song has been played, offering users insights into their listening habits.
